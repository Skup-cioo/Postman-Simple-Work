# Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my skills using Postman!

Inside this repository, you'll discover two Postman collections, each with carefully crafted tests and logic:

- *Simple Collection*: This collection interacts with the [Simple Grocery Store API](https://github.com/vdespa/Postman-Complete-Guide-API-Testing/blob/main/simple-grocery-store-api.md), demonstrating basic functionality.
  
- *Basic Crypto Collection*: Explore this collection to send GET requests and retrieve fundamental cryptocurrency data from [Coinpaprika API](https://api.coinpaprika.com/#tag/Coins/paths/~1coins/get).

Feel free to explore and utilize these collections to understand my capabilities with Postman.
