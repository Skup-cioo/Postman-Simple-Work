Hello, my name is Kacper. This is a simple sample of my capabilities using Postman

In this repository we will find two Postman collections. I created some tests and logic in both collections. Take a look if you want.
  -Simple Collection.postman_collection.json - https://github.com/vdespa/Postman-Complete-Guide-API-Testing/blob/main/simple-grocery-store-api.md -> That API I used.
  
  -Basic_Crypto_Collection.json - https://api.coinpaprika.com/#tag/Coins/paths/~1coins/get -> Here we can send several GET requests and get basic cryptocurrency data.
